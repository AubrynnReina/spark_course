1. There's an error with this message "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: org.apache.hadoop.io.nativeio.NativeIO$Windows.access0(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z"
That can be fixed by following the SOF issue with the same message. But please, remember to set the environment path, not just the environment variable.

2. With streaming, code should be written in .py files, rather than testing with .ipynb files due to interaction for the awaitTermination() method of the Spark stream.
